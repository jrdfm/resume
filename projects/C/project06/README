This is what the last three secret tests are testing:

  12. Tests whether your makefile is compiling multiple source files in the
      same compilation command (which defeats the purpose of separate
      compilation).

  13. Tests whether your makefile has any extra unnecessary dependencies.

  14. Tests whether your makefile has any missing dependencies.

      The results on this test were not high, meaning many people did not
      pass it.  Keep in mind what Section 5 of the Project #6 assignment
      said:

      a. One header file in this project includes another one, so your
         makefile MUST use one of the approaches discussed in class for
         handling dependencies in this situation.  (This was discussed in
         some detail in around 9 minutes of the video for Lecture #14 part
         (e).)  If your makefile didn't do this then it has a missing
         dependency.

      b. The last two public tests use compare_name_lists() defined in
         compare-name-lists.o (with associated header file
         compare-name-lists.h), so these public test executables and the
         object files for these tests needed different dependencies than the
         executables and object files for the other tests.

         To also paraphrase what Project #6 Section 5 said, your makefile
         must recompile anything that uses compare-name-list.o if it were to
         change (for example, if we were to give you a new version of it to
         fix a bug).  If it didn't do that then it has a missing dependency.

         And if any files include \texttt{compare-name-lists.h} they must be
         recompiled if it is changed as well (if we were to give you a new
         version of it).
